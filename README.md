# react_redux_moderate_tempate_bootstrap
Basic add and subtract react redux app template  with a more refine structure. Still needs one more pass to be advanced.

The advanced version is one its way.  

This one combines the state and non state containers so the actions Consts have to be imported into more then the store. 
The Zamboozal game will be more advanmced and use the proper redux structure, but this suffices for a moderte application.

There is a hook inthe redeucer to send the state to the back-end. It is not implemented in node yet and needs flushing out. 
This one uses Webback for basic styles and babel for ES2016. 

SASS is not used, but will be in the next app for the Zamboozal game.
